I left TODO markers anywhere things need to be finished up
I left XXX markers for 'interesting' sections of the code

1. Add new facility not fully validated
    I validate each input individually as they are each an individual React
    components. However this does not prevent some of the fields from being
    filled with the others being left empty. This can be fixed if the add
    facility component is factored into its own view and validated in a 
    special way. I believe it would be way too messy to messy to do it all in
    Facility.js

2. Timestamp/time not enforced or validated in Response.js 
    I blame javascript 

3. Timestamp bucket not implemented
    I blame javascript

4. Repetable sub_surveys not implemented
    The solution has been thought out, however the implementation may introduce
    more bugs (espicially with the 'unique qid' thing i mentioned in the TODO.
    Was not worth it to do im my last two days. (Also it would complicate
    submission)

5. Flesh out logic
    Some min max's were implemented. Could really thing of much more

6. Photos are stored as PNG base64 strings, need to be done as JPGs

7. Photo View is not well designed

8. Extensive offline testing needs to be done (espicially the 'i turned off my
phone case')
